## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from v1.1. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Per-section Suspense boundaries | Requires data layer refactoring, defer to v1.2 |
| Dynamic OG image generation | Static image sufficient for portfolio |
| Multiple error page variants | Single branded error page sufficient |
| Admin error boundaries | Focus on public portfolio first |
| Original brand colors for icons | Monochrome matches design system better |
